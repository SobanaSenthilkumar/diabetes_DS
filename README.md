# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction Dashboard

An interactive **Streamlit** dashboard that predicts diabetes risk using machine learning models.
Built end-to-end in **Python**, it supports both **batch CSV uploads** and **single patient input**, with model performance comparison and **SHAP-based explainability**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 **Batch Prediction** from uploaded CSV files
* 🧠 **4 Trained ML Models**:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
  * SVM
* 🏆 **Model Evaluation**:

  * Average risk per model
  * Automatically identifies **Best**, **Average**, and **Worst** models
* 👤 **Single Patient Prediction** via form input
* 📊 **SHAP Summary Plot** to explain feature importance

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

* Upload a CSV file to evaluate diabetes risk for multiple patients.
* Compare average risk across **4 models**.
* Input values for a **single patient** to get instant prediction.
* Visualize **which features contribute most** to the prediction using SHAP.
